this is for html templates(rendering html)

flask templating language called jinja allows for us to write a little python inside html documents
allows for a bunch of stuff without using javascript. If you want to write JS, or CSS, add images etc
you would put in the static folder and load them in html

base.html template is the "theme" of the webiste, instructs what the website is generally going to look like 
home.html, etc will "exten" base.html

base.html will import "bootstrap" which is a CSS framework with built in classes making it easier to style website
the link to a cdn(content delivery network) that will load a bunch of custom CSS in javascript(see "stylesheet")
thigns will still work without it but won't look as nice.
